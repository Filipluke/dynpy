# Introduction

It's a module that allows to enginering calculations on dynamical systems. 

There are four main parts of the entire project:

- dynamics module

- mechanical models - lead of development and maintenance: Amadeusz Radomski (@amvdek); Grzegorz DÅ‚ugopolski (@grzegorzdl);

- symbolic and numeric solvers for ODE systems;

- reporting module.

Using the code below in Jupyter enviroment on [Free Access Project](https://cocalc.com/app?project-invite=hXnPFLqokQsoK6TG) <- ([CLICK LINK](https://cocalc.com/app?project-invite=hXnPFLqokQsoK6TG)) we can learn more about how to and what to use Python in engineering calculations:

    from dynpy.utilities.documents.document import IntroToCocalcGuide, UsageOfDynamicSystemsGuide
    IntroToCocalcGuide();

Run this code in the blank Jupyter you have created.

You will see the guide in Output after running it, i.e. a CELL-by-CELL (step-by-step) procedure. 

Next for an example, run the codes below and you will see how it works:

    import sympy 
    from sympy import Symbol
    
    from dynpy.models.mechanics.pendulum import Pendulum
    
    Pendulum().interactive_preview()

You can preview the pendulum using such a function.

If you are looking for information on reporting and creating a PDF file, we can use the command below to view the tutorial:

	from dynpy.utilities.documents.document import BasicsOfReportingGuide
	BasicsOfReportingGuide();
