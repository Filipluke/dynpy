# Introduction

It's a module that allows to enginering calculations on dynamical systems. 

There are four main parts of the entire project:

- dynamics module

- mechanical models - lead of development and maintenance: Amadeusz Radomski (@amvdek); Grzegorz DÅ‚ugopolski (@grzegorzdl);

- symbolic and numeric solvers for ODE systems;

- reporting module.

Using the code below in Jupyter enviroment on Ongoing Project we can learn more about how to and what to use Python in engineering calculations:

    from dynpy.utilities.documents.document import IntroToCocalcGuide, UsageOfDynamicSystemsGuide
    IntroToCocalcGuide();
